    <p>
        This is one of traditional Russian dishes that you will find in every restaurant as well as every home. Actually, it’s a Russian dish with a heavy French influence since it’s cooked in a cream sauce. There is actually quite a bit of French influence in Russian cuisine and I love it. I’m a big fan of cream sauces and wine sauces so French cooking is one of my favorite. (Aside from Italian, of course.)

        Mushrooms Julienne is traditionally made with just sour cream and cheese over the top. Heavy whipping cream was not a popular ingredient in Russia and was actually hard to find, so it wasn’t used in many recipes. My mom started using heavy cream in Mushroom Julienne after moving to the states and that is the recipe that stuck with me. I like the use of heavy cream because it cuts down on the sour cream and adds smooth creaminess to the sauce instead.
